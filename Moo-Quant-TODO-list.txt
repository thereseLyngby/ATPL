Moo-Quant TODO list 


Generator:
- implement grid representation, to be able to calculate unitaries, and to able to make all permutations
- implement generation, generate all permutations of circuit with depth, and gate set
- create unitaries, Create "function" that can calculate unitaries (should have been done before?, 
- implement hashing, Find hashing library and create the hash-map
- store the finger prints in a data base ( only save the best)


Optimizer:
- implement tiling, using sliding window
- implement validation checks (with stricter rules on a reduced quantum set)
- implement substitution
- check resulting validity


If more time: 
- see if we can parallelize parts of the generation algorithm (should be the easy thing to parallelize)
- parallelizing tiling (using the method, suggested by Avery)
-
